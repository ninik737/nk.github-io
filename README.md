LED Candle - For my Final Culminating I made a simple switch circuit. I began soldering the circuit to a board but did not have time to finish. I also sketched and designed a model for the LED candle in OnShape. The main idea of this item is to recreate LED candles and prove that they are easier and safer to use.

Additionally, the candle can be altered to have light sensors to work automatically, as well as heat sensors to avoid overuse and burning. I created a simpler version because there was not enough time to make anything too detailed. I also did not have the ability to buy new resources and could only use parts from my original circuit immitating a car.
